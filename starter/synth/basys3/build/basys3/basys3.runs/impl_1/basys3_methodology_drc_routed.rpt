TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree

No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_100 and clk_25_175_mmcm_100_to_25_175 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_100] -to [get_clocks clk_25_175_mmcm_100_to_25_175]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mmcm_100_to_25_175/inst/clk_100 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mmcm_100_to_25_175/inst/clk_100. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_100 and clk_25_175_mmcm_100_to_25_175 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>
